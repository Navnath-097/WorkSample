OrangeHRM is an open-source HR Management project. While working on this open-source project wrote test scenarios and test cases, prepared Defect Report and RTM. And automated around 45 test cases using Selenium. In this project I have used the following methods: handling alerts, handling elements (like buttons, check boxes, links, radio buttons, text fields, etc.), handling dropdown lists, handling frames, handling multiple windows, taking screenshots, adding implicit and explicit waits, context-click, drag and drop actions, mouse hover actions, handling auto suggestions, handling links, also used press and release key actions, etc. As for programming I have used Java language, for build management Maven, and TestNG for maintaining tests.
